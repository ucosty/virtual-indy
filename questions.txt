- SLTI/ADDI/ORI/etc	rs is signed?
- SLTIU/ADDIU/etc	rs is signed?
* they can be either sign-extended or the compare is unsigned

- if a 32bit action is performed, what happens to the upper 32 bit of a register? unchanged? sign extended? set to 0?
> this is applicable for e.g. AND: an ADD has a DADD counter part which AND does not seem to have

- delay slot: next instruction (the delay slot) is always executed, even when the jump is not executed? - yes, that's why it's often a NOP (matt)

- how does a mips react when there's nothing mapped in a memory range and data is read from/written to it? - bus error, if I remember correctly (matt)
